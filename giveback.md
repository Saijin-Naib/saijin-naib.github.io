{{site.author.name}} believes strongly in the Open Source movement and that one should give back to the tools that make work and play possible.

To this end, {{site.author.name}} pledges to donate 1% of the gross income from each contract to each of the end-user FOSS tools that were used for that contract.

In addition, 1% of the gross income from each contract will also be given to local non-profits that serve the Community.
