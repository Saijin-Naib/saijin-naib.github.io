{{site.author.name}} believes strongly in the power and value of Free, Open Source Software (FOSS), as well as Open-Standard/Open-Format data. The combination of these two techologies helps to ensure that you maintain data auditability, portability, and sovereignty.

However, why would that matter to you?

### Data Auditability
This refers to the ability to audit and inspect your data, and even more importantly, the tools and processes used to generate said data. For data to have strong auditability, you should have multiple options to view and interact with the data. This ensures that the data are well-formed, conform to their respective standards, and exhibit wide adoptability.

## Data Portability
This refers to the ability to "move" your data where you wish. In many cases, this can be something as simple as wanting to open a file on a different machine. Can you easily view the file? In other cases, this could mean viewing the file on a different operating system. With strong data portability, you are assured of the ability to view and use your data in more places.

## Data Sovereignty
This refers to the ability to maintain control of your data, free of outside commercial interests. With strong data sovereignty an outside entity can not decide that you no longer have access to your data if you don't pay for their service/software, nor can they make breaking changes between releases that block your ability to load or export your own data.
